# SwiftUI_Development

Includes both excersices made for getting familiarized with the SwiftUI framework and completed projects that I completed in university. 
Contains both projects, "RCPAR" and "Kentica", both of these fortunately were winning Apps for both the local and lational phase of the 2023 iOS Community Changemakers Hackathon 
Both apps are paired with their Keynote file and additional assets (like logos or other videos) used for presenting each product to the corresponding jury at the local and national hackathon.
